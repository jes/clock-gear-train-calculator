# Clock Gear Train Calculator

https://incoherency.co.uk/clock-gear-train-calculator/

This tool searches for possible clock gear trains to satisfy the target ratio.

It assumes:
- The first shaft only has a wheel (driving gear)
- Middle shafts have both a pinion (driven gear) and a wheel
- The last shaft only has a pinion
- So for 3 gear reductions, there are 4 shafts
